Speka: a tiny OO language
Speka is a really small language. The reason I designed this language was to learn how to write a interpreter for a dynamic object-oriented language.
It has a simple syntax (for now), and is really easy to be implemented, yet powerful.
Users can extend the functionality of the language or embed it into their applications very easily.
The parser is a hand-written resursive descent parser.
The compiler would generate a intermediate experssion, which runs on a stack-based virtual machine.
